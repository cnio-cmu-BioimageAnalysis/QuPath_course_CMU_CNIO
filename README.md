# QuPath Course - Confocal Microscopy Unit at CNIO

This is a repository with the guide and datasets created for a QuPath course in the Confocal Microscopy Unit at CNIO. This course covers image analysis for brightfield and fluorescence images.

During this course, you will learn to use QuPath from the most basic tasks to some complex workflow, with practical examples, using microscopy datasets.

## Contents

- **Documents folder**: Contains a PDF file with a presentation explaining basic concepts before starting with QuPath, and a step-by-step guide to complete all the practical exercises of this course.
- **Datasets**: All the datasets used during this course are uploaded to Google Drive and can be downloaded by accessing the URL contained inside `Datasets download.txt` or from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13JEtxtspc8KR-JfI_tGM0_K2-m4Xv80R?usp=drive_link).
